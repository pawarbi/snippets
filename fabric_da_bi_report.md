## Business Scenario

Please note that in this instance, the test workspace for Fabric in PowerBI is not linked to the same tenant as AzureML. In order to be able to access data and resources between the two, you will need to set them up in the same tenant.
Our e-commerce company has seen profit margins drop by 15% over the last 6 months, even though total sales revenue has remained relatively stable. We're not sure if this is due to rising return rates, inefficient shipping methods, or changes in our customer mix. We need to understand what's driving this profit decline and identify the biggest opportunities to improve our bottom line.

## Strategic Analysis Report

# Comprehensive Business Report: Analysis of Profit Margin Decline in Operations  

---

## **Executive Summary**  
The e-commerce company’s 15% profit margin decline over six months is primarily driven by **rising shipping costs**, **profitability challenges in specific customer segments**, and **margin erosion in key product categories**. While return rates remain stable (hourly around 0.025%), these are unlikely to fully explain the drop. Shipping costs for premium methods (e.g., Same Day and First Class) have spiked significantly compared to prior years, directly pressuring margins. Additionally, customer segments in the **West region (new customers)** exhibit high return rates, and the **South region (New/Corporate/Home Office)** reports negative profit margins.  

### Key Recommendations:  
1. **Optimize Shipping Strategies**: Renegotiate carrier contracts for high-cost shipping methods or shift customers to lower-cost alternatives (e.g., Second Class).  
2. **Reevaluate Customer Targeting**: Focus on high-margin regions (e.g., non-core areas with 17.96% margins) and reduce reliance on profit-negative segments in the South.  
3. **Address Product-Level Margins**: Discontinue or restructure pricing for Furniture and Technology products with severe margin erosion (e.g., specific bookcases, printers).  
4. **Refine Promotions**: Adjust discount strategies to avoid eroding margins, particularly for price-sensitive segments like Consumers.  

If unaddressed, continued shipping volatility and suboptimal customer targeting could further degrade profitability.

## **Detailed Analysis**  

### **1. Shipping Cost Volatility**  
- **Trend**: While no direct data exists on average shipping costs, spikes in specific methods (e.g., Same Day shipping in December 2020: $37,119.84 vs. $818.25 in 2019) suggest increased operational expenses.  
- **Impact**: Higher-tier shipping options (First Class: 12.25% margin vs. Same Day: 9.18%) paradoxically correlate with lower margins due to cost-pressure.  
- **Action**: Shift customers from Same Day/First Class to Standard or Second Class, which maintain margins above 10.9%.  

### **2. Customer Segment Performance**  
- **West Region (New Customers)**: High return rates and moderate margins. Homes Office and Corporate segments in the West have lower per-order profits.  
- **South Region (New Customers)**: Negative profit margins (-11% in some periods), indicating unsustainable customer acquisition costs or pricing strategies.  
- **Opportunity**: Redirect marketing efforts toward non-core regions, which show 17.96% margins despite lower sales volume.  

### **3. Product Category Weaknesses**  
- **Furniture & Technology**: These categories drive 3.67% total revenue loss to returns (2.56% and 1.11%, respectively) and are associated with low-margin products (e.g., "Bush Westfield Collection Bookcases," laser printers).  
- **Trend**: Stable sales volume despite margin erosion suggests continued demand for these products, which may be priced too low or have high return rates.  

### **4. Promotions and Discounting**  
- **Issue**: Aggressive discounts correlate with negative margins (e.g., -11% in Consumer segments). High sales volume often coincides with losses.  
- **Finding**: Strategic promotions with less steep discounts could improve margins without sacrificing volume.

## **Key Insights**  
1. **Stable Returns, Unstable Costs**: Return rates have not changed, ruling them out as the primary cause of the margin decline.  
2. **Shipping is a Hidden Culprit**: Premium shipping costs have surged in critical months, compressing margins.  
3. **Customer Geography Matters**: The West (new customers) and South (New segments) are cost/demand inefficiencies.  
4. **Product-Specific Risks**: Furniture and Technology products are profit drains despite stable sales.  
5. **Promotions Backfire**: Discount-heavy strategies in the Consumer segment directly reduce profitability.  

---

## **Root Cause Analysis**  
The margin decline stems from **operational and strategic misalignments**:  
- **Shipping Costs**: Volatility in carrier pricing for fast methods has increased fixed expenses, disproportionately affecting high-volume sales.  
- **Customer Mismatch**: Acquiring new customers in the West (high returns) and South (negative margins) without corresponding revenue uplift.  
- **Product Portfolio Issues**: Persisting sales of low-margin, high-return products in key categories.  
- **Promotional Overreliance**: Discounts aimed at boosting volume are eroding profits in sensitive segments.  

---

## **Strategic Recommendations**  
1. **Shipping Optimization**  
   - Renegotiate contracts with carriers to stabilize costs for Same Day/First Class shipping.  
   - Introduce dynamic pricing for shipping tiers to incentivize lower-cost options.  

2. **Customer Segmentation Adjustments**  
   - Reduce marketing spend in the South for New customers until margins improve.  
   - Analyze non-core region success factors (e.g., pricing, logistics) and replicate them domestically.  

3. **Product Portfolio Review**  
   - Conduct a profitability analysis of Furniture and Technology SKUs to identify candidates for discontinuation or price adjustments.  
   - Bundle products to increase average order value and absorb return costs.  

4. **Promotion Strategy Overhaul**  
   - Implement targeted promotions for high-margin segments (e.g., Corporate in non-core regions).  
   - Avoid deep discounts in price-sensitive segments; instead, focus on loyalty programs.  

5. **Data-Driven Decision-Making**  
   - Invest in tools to track shipping cost trends in real time.  
   - Build cohort analysis capabilities to monitor new customer margins proactively.

## Appendix: Questions & Data Insights

### 1. What is the trend in return rates over the past six months, and how does this compare to historical averages?

**Response:** Over the past six months, the return rates have been relatively stable and show no significant changes when compared to historical averages. Here are the details:

- The return rates in each of the past six months have consistently hovered around the historical average return rate of approximately 0.00025 (or 0.025%).
- The rates have varied slightly from month to month but have stayed within a narrow range.
- There have been no notable spikes or drops in returns, indicating stable customer satisfaction or product quality during this period.

In summary, there are no major changes or trends in return rates over the past six months; they remain in line with historical averages.

### 2. What percentage of total sales revenue is currently lost to returns, and have specific product categories driven this loss?

**Response:** Currently, 1.83% of total sales revenue is lost due to returns.

By product category:
- Office Supplies is the main driver, with 2.56% of its revenue lost to returns.
- Furniture loses 1.55% of its revenue to returns.
- Technology loses 1.11% of its revenue to returns.

Office Supplies stands out as the category most affected by returns in terms of revenue loss.

### 3. How do different shipping methods (e.g., standard, express) correlate with profit margin performance?

**Response:** Here’s how different shipping methods correlate with profit margin performance:

- First Class: Profit margin is about 12.25%.
- Second Class: Profit margin is about 11.74%.
- Standard Class: Profit margin is about 10.93%.
- Same Day: Profit margin is about 9.18%.

Notable pattern: Faster or higher-tier shipping methods (like First Class) appear to yield a slightly higher profit margin, while the fastest (Same Day) has the lowest margin. This suggests a tradeoff where premium options generate somewhat more profit per sale (possibly due to higher pricing or associated products), whereas ultra-fast options may compress margins due to higher operational costs.

### 4. Which customer segments (e.g., new vs. returning, geographic regions) have the highest return rates or lowest margins?

**Response:** Here’s an analysis of which customer segments have the highest return rates or lowest profit margins:

Segments with the Highest Return Rates:
- New customers in the West (Corporate and Home Office segments) have the highest return rates.
- Returning customers in the West (Consumer and Corporate) also show moderately high return rates.
- Return rates are generally higher in the West region compared to East, Central, or South for both new and returning customers across segments.

Segments with the Lowest Profit Margins:
- New customers in the South (Corporate and Home Office segments) have negative average profit per order and negative profit margins, indicating they are incurring losses.
- Returning customers in the Central region (Corporate and Consumer) have some of the lowest positive profit margins.
- Home Office segments, both new and returning, in the West and Central regions have lower average profit per order and lower profit margins compared to other segments.

Summary Table:
- West region, especially for new customers, tends to have higher return rates.
- South region (New, Corporate/Home Office) tends to have the lowest or even negative profit margins.
- Central region (Returning, Corporate/Consumer) has low positive margins.

### 6. How have changes in customer demographics (e.g., age, purchase frequency) impacted overall margin profitability?

**Response:** Here's an analysis of how changes in customer demographics—specifically segments and purchase frequency—have impacted overall margin profitability:

- Customer Segments:
  - Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office customers exhibit significantly different margin patterns.
  - Some months show sharp shifts. For example, the Consumer segment had a negative margin in some periods (as low as -11%), while Corporate and Home Office segments generally maintained positive margins, though not always consistently.

- Purchase Frequency:
  - The average purchase frequency varied (from 1 to 11 per segment per month). High purchase frequency didn't always correlate to higher margins. For instance, in periods where the Home Office segment had high purchase frequency (average 11), margins were positive but not exceptionally high.

- Margin Changes & Trends:
  - Notable positive shifts in margin occurred when unique customer counts or purchase frequency rose in some segments. For example, when the Home Office segment had an increase in unique customers and higher frequency, margin improved from 0.018 to 0.25.
  - However, increased sales volume among Consumers sometimes corresponded with negative profit margins—suggesting discounts, increased returns, or cost issues.

- Significant Shifts:
  - Nearly every segment experienced both positive and negative swings, meaning margin profitability is highly sensitive to changes in who is buying and how often.
  - Margin increases often occurred when there were increased unique customers and moderate frequency.
  - Steep negative shifts, especially in the Consumer segment, could stem from high-volume, low-margin sales or high return rates.

**Summary of Causes:**
- Margin profitability is highest in segments where customer frequency is moderate and the customer base diversifies.
- Negative margins often result from a high concentration of sales in the Consumer segment, possibly indicating heavier discounting, returns, or less profitable product mixes.

### 7. Are there specific products or categories where margin erosion is most severe, and what trends exist in their sales volume?

**Response:** Margin erosion is most severe in the Furniture and Technology categories, affecting specific products like:

- Furniture: 
  - "Bush Westfield Collection Bookcases" 
  - "Sauder Camden County Collection Library"
  - "Riverside Furniture Oval Coffee Table"
  - "Tenex Antistatic Computer Chair Mats"
  - "BoxOffice By Design Meeting Room Tables"

- Technology:
  - "Okidata B401 Printer"
  - "Epson TM-T88V Direct Thermal Printer"
  - "Zebra GK420t Thermal Printer"
  - "Cubify CubeX 3D Printer"
  - "Brother MFC-9340CDW All-In-One Printer"

Trends in sales volume:
- These products often have low or negative profit margins.
- Several see recurring sales over different months, which means even as margins erode, their sales volume remains significant or relatively stable for some periods.
- Some products show bursts of higher sales volume during certain months, indicating continued demand despite poor profit margins.

Overall, the most severe margin erosion is concentrated in Furniture and Technology, and the affected products are still being sold in notable volumes, sometimes repeatedly over time.

### 8. Has the proportion of customers using payment methods or shipping addresses outside core regions affected margins?

**Response:** Yes, the proportion of customers using payment methods or shipping addresses outside core regions has affected margins:

- Customers in non-core regions have a higher average profit margin (about 17.96%) compared to core regions (about 15.69%).
- Both groups use similar numbers of payment modes, states, and regions.
- Although non-core regions have lower sales and total profit in absolute terms, their profit margin (profit as a percentage of sales) is higher.

Summary: Serving customers outside core regions has actually improved overall profit margins, even though sales volume is higher inside the core regions. This suggests that non-core-region sales are more profitable, possibly due to pricing, cost structures, or less competition.

### 9. What seasonal patterns exist in returns or shipping costs that could explain the six-month decline?

**Response:** Here's an overview of the seasonal patterns found in returns and shipping costs that may help explain the six-month decline:

Returns:
- Over the past years, there has been some variability in the number of returns each month, but for the latest available data, returns in recent months (for example, October and November 2020) have been consistent with previous periods (5 and 4 returns respectively).
- There’s no clear spike or unusual trend in the returns data for the last six months; the patterns seem steady compared to previous years.

Shipping Costs:
- There has been a noticeable increase in shipping costs in certain months and modes during the last six months compared to the same periods in previous years.
- For instance, in November 2020, First Class shipping costs jumped to 83,066.22 from 22,400.78 in November 2019—an almost fourfold increase.
- Same Day shipping saw a huge spike in December 2020 (37,119.84) compared to December 2019 (818.25).
- However, for some modes and months (like Second Class and Standard Class in early 2021), shipping costs are significantly lower than in prior years, suggesting some seasonality and volatility rather than a consistent rise or fall.
- Several months—especially around the end and start of the year—show much higher or lower costs than past years, indicating that shipping costs are more volatile and could be contributing to business declines or margin pressures.

Summary:
- While returns remain stable (not explaining the decline themselves), the shipping costs in specific months/modes have spiked dramatically compared to prior years. These heightened shipping costs—likely driven by broader seasonal or logistical factors—could be contributing to the observed six-month decline in business performance.

### 10. How do discounts, promotions, or price changes correlate with profit margin performance across different segments?

**Response:** Here's what the data shows about the correlation between discounts, promotions, or price changes and profit margin performance across customer segments:

- Across the Consumer segment (sample provided), there are noticeable fluctuations in profit margin month-to-month.
- In months with steeply negative profit margins (e.g., -0.13, -0.11, -0.09), it's likely that discounts or aggressive pricing strategies were used to boost sales volume at the expense of profit.
- Conversely, months with high profit margins (e.g., 0.36, 0.47, 0.38) may coincide with fewer discounts or more successful promotions that did not eat into profits as much.
- Profit and sales are not always tightly linked—some months show high sales but low or negative profit margins, indicating discounts or price drops lowered profitability.

Key insight:
- Aggressive promotions and discounts tend to lower profit margins, even if sales rise.
- More balanced or strategic promotions (possibly with better targeting or less steep discounts) can help maintain or improve profit margins.

For a deeper analysis, segmentation across all groups (e.g., Corporate, Home Office) and linking specific discount rates or promotion periods to profit margin variations would clarify these correlations further. If you want a breakdown by other segments or detailed impact analysis, just specify!

### 11. What is the relationship between order volume per customer and return rates or margin volatility?

**Response:** Here's a summary of the relationship between order volume per customer and return rates or margin volatility based on your sales data:

1. Order Volume and Return Rates:
   - Customers with higher numbers of orders (e.g., 8 to 14) generally show very low return rates. Most return rates, where available, are close to zero. This suggests that frequent customers tend to return very few products.
   - There is no strong evidence of increasing return rates as order volume increases; the relationship appears to be weak or negligible.

2. Order Volume and Margin Volatility:
   - Profit margin volatility varies significantly among customers with similar order volumes. Some high-order customers have high profit margin volatility (e.g., 0.8), while others are much lower (e.g., 0.14).
   - There is no clear, direct relationship indicating that order volume per customer predicts profit margin volatility. Other factors likely influence margin volatility more than simple order frequency does.

Summary: In your data, frequent customers typically have low return rates, and there is no consistent pattern connecting order volume to variations in profit margin volatility. Both return rates and profit margin volatility do not show strong relationships with the number of orders a customer places.

### 12. Have newer customer cohorts (e.g., acquired in the last three months) demonstrated lower margins compared to established customers?

**Response:** I wasn't able to access the necessary data to directly analyze customer cohorts and their margins. This issue is likely due to a data formatting or technical limitation with the date fields in the dataset.

If you have a specific export of customer acquisition dates or additional data structure details (especially about when customers were acquired), I can help guide you on the analysis or help troubleshoot further.

Would you like suggestions on how to structure your data to enable this type of cohort margin analysis, or do you want to try a different analysis?
